# geography-site-exploit
A script written for the popular seterra website. You just have to paste it into the websites console and it does the work for you.

Currently works on most of the pages where you have to guess the location of a country. It does this by finding the string that tells you what country you have to find, then comparing it to the list of all the possibilities and clicking the trigger that matches.

If you use this and see that it doesn't run on one of the exercises, contact me, I know there are pages it doesn't run on, but I didn't have time to fix it yet.
